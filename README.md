### Problem Statement

Snow Cone Games are a digital retailer for video games. We need to find new ways to categorize games on their homepage. 

Only 23% of buyers search for games using the genre filter (e.g., action, sports, etc). 71% of buyers use advanced filters to find the types of games that appeal to them. We hope that creative new categories based on different game attributes can help players find what they are looking for faster.

### Goal

* Group the data into categories that make sense.
* Avoid more than five categories if possible, as any more would be difficult to fit into the platform homepage. 

### Data Used

* Snow Cone Gamesâ€™ library has got over 40,000 video games.
* The data used for this analysis can be accessed here: `"data/video_games.csv"`
